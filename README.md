<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I went to a secondary school called St.Dominics College. It was a big secondary school with nearly 1000 people attending it every day. It was all girls school. It was originally a convent set up by 6 nuns who came from Australia. It has been modernised and now is run as a secondary school. My three favourite subjects were:<ul><li>Geography</li><li>Maths</li><li>Home Economics</li></ul></p>
